        Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has led the praise for David De Gea, following the Spaniard's miraculous double save against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday.
        
        Our no.1 produced a world-class contribution in the 70th minute by not once but twice denying Romain Saiss from close range, keeping out the initial header before blocking the fierce follow-up.

        The moment of goalkeeping magic from De Gea proved to be absolutely vital, because United went on to secure a vital 1-0 victory thanks to Mason Greenwood's third goal of the season so far.

        Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praised 'special' contributions from David De Gea and Mason Greenwood, as the Reds edged to victory over Wolves at Molineux.

        The boss was happy to admit that his side were not at our free-flowing best for large parts of the game, but that victory in front of a raucous home support tasted pretty sweet regardless.

        Read the main points from the manager's interview with Sky Sports and his post-match press conference - plus his MUTV interview - below. Included are Ole's view on the winning goal and where he thinks Cristiano Ronaldo will fit into this team once his move from Juventus goes through.

       Manchester United’s youngsters recorded our first win of the season in the U18 Premier League, with the Reds defeating Leeds United 3-0 at Thorp Arch on Saturday afternoon.

       United struck twice in the opening quarter of the game, first through Dan Gore, who found the net with a smartly taken left-foot finish after 12 minutes.
       <br><br><br>
       <span class="sam">Sam Mather</span> then doubled our lead 10 minutes later, finishing off a fluid move in an action-packed start in West Yorkshire.
       Goalkeeper Eric Hanbury, making his Under-18s debut, was called upon throughout proceedings and did well to keep his clean sheet intact, denying Keelan Carole and then Mitch Picksley on separate occasions, before Kobbie Mainoo rounded off proceedings in the sixth minute of stoppage time, following up on Manni Norkett’s initial effort, which was saved by <span class="harry">Harry Christy</span>.
